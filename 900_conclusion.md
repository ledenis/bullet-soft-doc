Bullet Physics is piece of software that offers lots of possibilities, but is complex to use especially when few documentation resources are provided. I sincerely hope this document can help non experienced users to learn more. However, it hardly covers all the subjects, and there is a lot more to learn and discover, especially about soft bodies.

To learn more about this physics engine, you can visit its website, which includes the wiki and the forums. Its source code also helps.
